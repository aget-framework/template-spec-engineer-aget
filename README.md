# AGET: CLI Agent Template

> **Mission: Help CLI-using creators to build better software enjoyably faster (using CLI coding agents)**

**Agent Template (AGET)** - Cognitive augmentation framework for software and data work. Transform any project into a CLI agent-ready environment with conversational command patterns. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, and all major AI coding assistants.

**Current Version**: v2.5.0 "Validation"

## Branch Strategy
- **main branch**: Stable release (v2.5.0 "Validation")
- **develop branch**: Next features (v2.6.0+)
- See [.aget/BRANCHING.md](.aget/BRANCHING.md) for details

> **📍 Strategic Vision & Governance**: Vision and governance documents now live in [aget-aget](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget). This repository focuses on stable implementation. See [GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md](docs/GOVERNANCE_POINTER.md) for details.

## Who This Is For

- **Software Owners** governing their project's evolution
- **Contributors** needing private workspace for external projects
- **Analysts** examining codebases without modifying
- **Data Scientists** organizing standalone analysis (Spotify, financial, etc.)
- **Developers** wanting consistent patterns across projects
- **Learners** using AI to understand and build software

## What This Provides

AGET implements a specification-driven development framework with:
- **Spec templates**: Define what you want before building
- **Session management**: `hey` → work → `wind down` → `sign off`
- **AI interaction**: Natural language commands that work consistently
- **Progressive understanding**: Start empty, grow knowledge over time
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with all major AI assistants

## Quick Start (30 Seconds)

### How AGET Works

AGET is not a traditional CLI tool. You interact through your AI assistant using natural language:

1. **Clone AGET** into your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmelli/aget-cli-agent-template.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template
```

2. **Open with your AI coding assistant**:
```bash
# Claude Code (primary testing)
claude .

# Also works with: Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Codex CLI, and other CLI agents
cursor . | aider . | windsurf .
```

3. **Start with natural language**:
```
You: hey
AI: [Checks environment, reports status, ready for commands]

You: initialize this as an agent project
AI: [Sets up agent structure with workspace/, products/, docs/]

You: create a Python scraper tool
AI: [Builds tool in workspace/, adds tests, documentation]
```

### Behind the Scenes

Your AI assistant discovers and uses AGET patterns automatically. You never type `aget` commands directly - the AI handles that based on your natural language requests.

For more installation options and customization, see [docs/GET_STARTED.md](docs/GET_STARTED.md)

## 🚀 Try It Now! (2 Minutes)

Experience AGET with your AI assistant immediately:

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the template
git clone https://github.com/gmelli/aget-cli-agent-template.git
cd aget-cli-agent-template

# 2. Open with your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
claude .  # or: cursor . | code . | aider

# 3. Tell your AI assistant:
"hey"
```

Your AI will respond with project status, available patterns, and be ready for natural language commands like:
- `"run tests"` - Execute test suite
- `"check documentation"` - Analyze docs quality
- `"tidy up"` - Clean temporary files
- `"wind down"` - Save session and commit

### Live Example Session

```
You: hey

AI: Good morning! Let me check your environment...
    ✓ Working directory: ~/aget-cli-agent-template
    ✓ Git status: On branch main, clean
    ✓ Python version: 3.11.5
    ✓ Available patterns: 15 installed
    Ready for your commands!

You: let's build a Python web scraper tool

AI: I'll help you create a web scraper. Let me start by creating the project structure...
    [Creates workspace/scraper.py with requests and BeautifulSoup]
    ✓ Created main scraper module
    ✓ Added error handling and rate limiting
    ✓ Included user-agent headers
    Shall I add tests?

You: yes, and make it installable

AI: Creating package structure...
    [Creates setup.py, requirements.txt, tests/]
    ✓ Package structure created
    ✓ Unit tests added (3 passing)
    ✓ Installation tested successfully
    You can now: pip install -e .

You: wind down

AI: Saving session...
    ✓ Created session notes: SESSION_NOTES/2025-09-28.md
    ✓ Committed changes: "feat: Add hello world example"
    Session duration: 2 minutes
    Have a great day!
```

## Installation

> **⚠️ Important**: AGET is not a traditional CLI tool. You don't run `aget` commands directly. Instead, your AI assistant uses AGET patterns based on your natural language requests.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic command-line familiarity

### Method 1: Clone and Use Directly (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/gmelli/aget-cli-agent-template.git

# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/your-project

# Run aget commands using Python module syntax
python3 /path/to/aget-cli-agent-template/aget/__main__.py init
```

### Method 2: Create Alias for Convenience
Add to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
```bash
alias aget="python3 /path/to/aget-cli-agent-template/aget/__main__.py"
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use:
```bash
aget init
aget validate
aget list
```

## Usage

> **Note**: The commands below are what your AI assistant can execute behind the scenes. You interact through natural language like "hey", "initialize this", "run tests", not by typing these commands.

### Core Commands (AI Executes These)

#### Initialize a New Agent
```bash
# Create agent with standard patterns (recommended)
aget init --template agent --with-patterns

# Create tool with minimal patterns
aget init --template tool --with-patterns minimal

# Create hybrid agent/tool
aget init --template hybrid --with-patterns advanced
```

#### Validate Your Setup
```bash
# Check if your project meets AGET standards
aget validate

# Detailed validation with recommendations
aget validate --verbose
```

#### List Available Patterns
```bash
# Show all available patterns
aget list

# Show installed patterns
aget list --installed

# Show patterns by category
aget list --category session
```

#### Extract Tools to Products
```bash
# Extract a tool from workspace to products
aget extract --from workspace/my_tool.py --to products/

# Extract with dependencies
aget extract --from workspace/analyzer.py --to products/ --with-deps
```

### Session Management Commands
Your AI assistant will understand these natural language commands:

- **`hey`** or **`wake up`** - Start a session, check status
- **`wind down`** or **`save work`** - Save session with detailed notes
- **`sign off`** or **`all done`** - Quick save and exit
- **`tidy up`** - Clean temporary files
- **`deep clean`** - Archive old files and reorganize
- **`health check`** - Run diagnostics when something's wrong

### Working with Patterns
```bash
# Install a specific pattern
python3 patterns/session/session_manager.py --install

# Run a pattern directly
python3 patterns/housekeeping/cleanup.py --dry-run

# Check pattern documentation
python3 patterns/documentation/check_docs.py --help
```

## Why Universal Standards?

### The Configuration Fragmentation Problem

The current landscape of AI coding assistants creates configuration overhead. Each tool requires its own format:

- **Claude Code**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific instructions
- **Cursor**: Requires `.cursorrules` for behavior configuration
- **Windsurf**: Uses `.windsurfrules` for custom patterns
- **Aider**: Expects `.aider.conf.yml` for settings
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This fragmentation means maintaining multiple configuration files with duplicated content. Using multiple tools requires synchronizing changes across 3-5 different formats.

## What You Get

After installation, your CLI agent can understand commands like:

- **`hey`** - Initialize session with project status
- **`tidy up`** - Clean temporary files and caches
- **`deep clean`** - Deep cleanup with archiving
- **`check docs`** - Analyze documentation quality
- **`health check`** - Emergency diagnostics when something's wrong
- **`save work`** - Save session state and commit changes
- **`all done`** - Quick commit and push

## Features

✅ **Natural Language Commands** - Conversational interface for common tasks
✅ **Progressive Safety** - Dry-run → Modify → Reorganize
✅ **Session Management** - Context preservation across conversations
✅ **Emergency Recovery** - Diagnostic and recovery protocols

## How It Works

1. **Agent reads AGENTS.md** - Discovers available conversational command patterns
2. **Pattern discovery** - Agent automatically identifies workflow patterns from configuration
3. **Natural language triggers** - You say "hey", agent executes the corresponding pattern
4. **Safe-by-default** - Dry-run previews, rollback support, confirmation prompts
5. **Session persistence** - Context preservation across agent restarts

## Examples

### Starting a Session
```
You: hey
Agent: Running wake protocol...
       ✓ Working directory: ~/project
       ✓ Git status: 3 uncommitted changes
       ✓ Tests: 47 passing
       ✓ Documentation: Grade B
       Ready for tasks.
```

### Cleaning Up
```
You: spring clean
Agent: Running spring clean protocol (dry-run)...
       Would archive 5 old session notes
       Would remove 127 __pycache__ files
       Would clean 3.2MB temp files
       Run without --dry-run to execute.
```

### Emergency Recovery
```
You: sanity check
Agent: Running emergency diagnostics...
       ✓ Python 3.11.0
       ✓ Git repository OK
       ✓ Critical files present
       ✓ Imports working
       System Status: OK
```

## Upgrading

Already using the template? See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) for how to apply template enhancements to your existing projects. The guide provides a five-phased approach that preserves your customizations while getting new features.

## Testing

This agent template includes contract tests to validate core protocols:
- **Wake protocol contract**: Identity reporting validation
- **Identity contract**: Metadata consistency checks

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run contract tests only
python3 -m pytest tests/test_wake_contract.py tests/test_identity_contract.py -v
```

### What Contract Tests Validate

- Agent reports identity correctly (name, version)
- Version metadata is consistent across files
- Identity fields remain stable (separate from operational state)
- Addresses identity conflation issues (#76)

See `tests/README.md` for detailed test documentation.
