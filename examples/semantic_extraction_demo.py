Semantic Extraction Demonstration: private-github-AGET

This demonstrates ACTUAL coding agent workflow:
1. Coding agent (Claude) READ session file
2. Coding agent UNDERSTOOD what agent does
3. Coding agent EXTRACTED capabilities from comprehension
4. Coding agent USES extract_spec.py framework to structure output

NOT hardcoded - capabilities extracted from semantic understanding of:
- ~/github/private-github-aget/sessions/FIRST_SESSION_2025-09-27.md

What I understood from reading:
- Agent purpose: Workspace observer for monitoring git repositories
- Core function: Scans ~/github/ directory for repos
- Key capabilities:
  1. Enumerates git repositories (found 26)
  2. Identifies AGET-enabled repos (9 found)
  3. Tracks AGET versions (v2.0.0-alpha, etc.)
  4. Generates workspace reports (workspace_report_YYYYMMDD.md)
  5. Tracks recent activity (most recently modified repos)
  6. Performance monitoring (0.025s scan time)

Extraction confidence: Medium-High (session is clear but only covers first activation)
Expected quality: 60-70% (only 1 session read, limited coverage)
