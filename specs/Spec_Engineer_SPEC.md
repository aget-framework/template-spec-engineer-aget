# Spec_Engineer Capability Specification

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Active
**Owner**: template-spec-engineer-aget
**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Archetype**: Spec_Engineer

---

## Purpose

Transform requirements and patterns into formal, testable specifications using EARS methodology

---

## Scope

This specification defines the core capabilities that all spec engineer instances must provide.

### In Scope

- Core spec engineer capabilities (3 requirements)
- EARS-compliant requirement format
- Verification approach

### Out of Scope

- Instance-specific extensions
- Integration with specific tools or systems

---

## Requirements

### CAP-SE-001: Requirements Elicitation

**WHEN** performing spec engineer activities
**THE** agent SHALL extract and document stakeholder needs

**Rationale**: Core spec engineer capability
**Verification**: Instance demonstrates capability in operation

### CAP-SE-002: EARS Formalization

**WHEN** performing spec engineer activities
**THE** agent SHALL transform needs into ears-compliant requirements

**Rationale**: Core spec engineer capability
**Verification**: Instance demonstrates capability in operation

### CAP-SE-003: Specification Validation

**WHEN** performing spec engineer activities
**THE** agent SHALL verify specs are complete, consistent, and testable

**Rationale**: Core spec engineer capability
**Verification**: Instance demonstrates capability in operation

## Verification

| Requirement | Verification Method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| CAP-SE-001 | Operational demonstration |
| CAP-SE-002 | Operational demonstration |
| CAP-SE-003 | Operational demonstration |
