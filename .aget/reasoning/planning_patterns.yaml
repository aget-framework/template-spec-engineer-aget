# Template: template-spec-engineer-aget
# Version: 3.0.0

planning:
  approach: systematic
  style: extraction_first

  patterns:
    specification_authoring:
      steps:
        - Gather source material
        - Extract patterns and capabilities
        - Draft EARS requirements
        - Assign requirement IDs
        - Validate EARS compliance
        - Review traceability
        - Publish specification
      governance: L289 (evidence-first)

    reverse_engineering:
      steps:
        - Analyze existing implementation
        - Identify capabilities
        - Extract patterns
        - Formalize as EARS
        - Validate completeness
      governance: extraction_methodology

    spec_migration:
      steps:
        - Read current spec format
        - Map to EARS patterns
        - Reformat to v1.2
        - Validate compliance
        - Update traceability
      governance: L385 (spec reformatting)

  verification:
    required:
      - EARS syntax valid
      - IDs unique
      - Testable statements
    recommended:
      - Traceability complete
      - Peer reviewed
