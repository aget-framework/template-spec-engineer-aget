## When to Use Each Template

### Use **template-worker-aget** when:

✅ **You need flexibility**
- Want to switch between read-only and action-taking modes
- Need different capability profiles for different tasks
- Building general-purpose agent for varied work

✅ **You're building domain-specific tools**
- Data analysis agents (Spotify, financial data, logs)
- Code generation and modification agents
- Deployment and automation agents
- Research and documentation agents

✅ **You want standard agent capabilities**
- Standard wake/wind-down protocols
- Session management
- Learning evolution tracking
- No specialized communication styles needed

**Examples**:
- `my-spotify-analyst-aget` - Read-only data analysis
- `my-github-AGET` - GitHub PR creation and management
- `my-code-generator-AGET` - Scaffold and modify code
- `my-deployment-AGET` - Deploy to production environments

---

### Use **template-supervisor-aget** when:

✅ **You're coordinating multiple agents**
- Managing fleet of 5+ agents
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Enforcing cross-agent standards

✅ **You need lifecycle management**
- Creating and configuring new agents
- Migrating agents across versions
- Deploying patterns to agent fleet

✅ **You're doing framework R&D**
- Developing new AGET patterns
- Creating specifications (EARS format)
- Building shared learning repository

✅ **You have oversight responsibility**
- Reviewing agent work for quality
- Enforcing process protocols
- Coordinating releases

**Examples**:
- `my-supervisor-AGET` - Fleet coordinator managing 10 agents
- `team-lead-AGET` - Coordinating project team's agents
- `platform-manager-AGET` - Managing shared agent infrastructure

**Note**: Supervisor template currently **private** until patterns stabilize (expected v2.6+)

---

### Use **template-advisor-aget** when:

✅ **You want advisory-only mode**
- Never modify systems (compliance requirement)
- Always provide recommendations, never execute
- Read-only enforcement through contract tests

✅ **You need persona differentiation**
- **Teacher** - Educational content, structured learning
- **Mentor** - Career guidance, reflective questions
- **Consultant** - Trade-off analysis, formal recommendations
- **Guru** - Best practices, authoritative expertise
- **Coach** - Performance feedback, incremental improvement

✅ **You want built-in advisory protocols**
- Requirements Before Solutions (L114)
- Confidence levels in all recommendations
- Explicit assumption documentation
- Role boundary enforcement

✅ **You're building for governance**
- Architecture review boards
- Security advisory agents
- Code review agents (critique only)
- Decision support systems

**Examples**:
- `my-architecture-advisor-aget` (consultant persona) - System design guidance
- `my-security-advisor-aget` (guru persona) - Security best practices
- `my-code-review-coach-aget` (coach persona) - Code quality feedback
- `my-career-mentor-aget` (mentor persona) - Professional development

## Migration Between Templates

### Can I Convert Between Templates?

| From | To | Difficulty | Notes |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Worker → Advisor | ⚠️ Medium | Requires validation of read-only compliance, add persona config, expand tests to 16 |
| Worker → Supervisor | ⚠️ Medium | Requires multi-agent patterns, coordination protocols, fleet context |
| Advisor → Worker | ⚠️ Medium | **One-way door**: Removes read-only enforcement, requires architecture review |
| Advisor → Supervisor | ❌ Discouraged | Conflates advisory and execution roles (see D11 terminology) |
| Supervisor → Worker | ❌ Discouraged | Loses coordination capabilities, better to create separate agent |
| Supervisor → Advisor | ❌ Discouraged | Supervisors need action capability for agent management |

**Recommendation**: Start with the right template. Template conversions require significant rework and risk configuration drift.

# Supervisor template (fleet coordination) - Private until v2.6+
# Contact framework maintainer for access
```

### Next Steps

1. **Configure identity** - Edit `.aget/version.json`

3. **Customize documentation** - Update `AGENTS.md` with domain context
4. **Deploy** - Create GitHub repository (optional)

**Detailed guides**:
