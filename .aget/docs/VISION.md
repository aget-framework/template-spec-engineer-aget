# Specification-Driven Development: Clear Instructions for ever more 'Coding' Agents

**Specification-driven development is a discipline of formalizing system requirements into structured, verifiable contracts for AI coding agents.** Currently, specifications are mainly implicit in code (with minimal documentation). Instead, requirements are captured explicitly using formal patterns that eliminate ambiguity and enable validation. This continues software engineering's evolution toward explicitness—from test-driven development formalizing behavior, to declarative programming separating intent from implementation, to design by contract establishing formal agreements.

AI coding agents can support this practice throughout the lifecycle: they can help write and maintain specifications, generate code from those contracts, test implementations against formal requirements, and reverse engineer specifications from existing systems. Initially, only small systems will be fully formally defined. Larger systems can adopt semi-formal approaches—many implementation details remain in code, but critical behaviors are formally specified and verifiable. The key: what IS formally specified can be validated and, with effort, verified.

**Specifications serve dual purposes in the development cycle.** First, writing specifications accelerates learning—forcing precision reveals gaps, validates understanding, and builds confidence in discoveries. Second, specifications provide verified contracts for production work engineers perform anyway, whether building new systems or refactoring existing components.

**Two scenarios demonstrate the value:** For new systems, engineers already rebuild from prototypes rather than shipping exploration code. Formalizing prototype discoveries before rebuilding prevents requirement drift. For existing systems needing refactoring, reverse engineering components into specifications first—starting small—provides verified contracts rather than tribal knowledge for the refactoring work that would happen regardless.

**High-stakes scenarios amplify benefits.** Systems with SLO commitments, compliance requirements, or mission-critical functions cannot afford the requirement drift and shallow understanding that occurs when rebuilding from memory alone.

**The discipline extends established practice.** Engineers already separate exploration from production code—just as test-driven development separates behavior specification from implementation. Specification-driven development adds the formalization layer between discovery and production work, preserving and validating what code teaches before implementation begins. AI coding agents can make this practical by supporting specification creation, maintenance, code generation, and validation throughout the development lifecycle.
