## Update Protocol

### When to Update

**Coach**:
- After every 3-5 sessions (or when significant progress observed)
- When confidence level shifts (Â±2 points)
- When new focus area emerges

**Teacher**:
- After each session (mastery levels change frequently)
- When concept mastered (move to next topic)
- When learning pattern identified

**Mentor**:
- After key milestones (growth indicators)
- When relationship stage shifts
- Quarterly career progress check

---

### How to Update

**During session**:
- Observe progress indicators
- Note confidence shifts
- Identify new areas

**At wind down**:
```python
# Update client progress (if applicable)
Edit: .aget/client_progress/{client_id}.yaml

# Example changes:
# - Increment total_sessions
# - Update confidence_level in focus_area
# - Add progress_note with date
# - Update mastery_level (teacher)
```

---

## Usage Protocol

### At Wake Up
```
ðŸ“Š Progress: 12 sessions, +2 confidence in strategic thinking
```

Display brief progress summary if persona requires high state need (coach/teacher).

---

### During Session
- Reference progress: "You've grown from 5 to 7 in confidence since we started"
- Identify patterns: "I notice this is the 3rd time you've mentioned delegation"
- Celebrate milestones: "You've mastered 8 concepts in 2 months!"

---

### In Status Checks
```
User: "status"

Coach response:
ðŸ“Š Client Progress

Sessions: 12 total (last: 2025-10-10)
Focus areas:
  â€¢ Strategic thinking: 7/10 (+2 since start)
  â€¢ Delegation: 4/10 (newly identified)

Overall trajectory: Steady growth
Key shift: Moved from seeking answers to asking questions
```

## Privacy & Sensitivity

**Data classification**: Sensitive (client performance, personal development)

**Access control**: Advisor agent only

**Retention**: Keep for duration of advisory relationship + 90 days

**Deletion**: When client relationship ends (documented in exit protocol)

---

## Persona-Specific Guidance

### Coach (High Need)
**Track actively**: Confidence levels are critical for coaching effectiveness.

**Update frequency**: Every 3-5 sessions

**Key metrics**:
- Confidence levels (1-10 scale)
- Focus areas and progress notes
- Development trajectory

**Anti-pattern**: Don't track task completion (that's project management, not coaching)

---

### Teacher (High Need)
**Track actively**: Mastery levels determine curriculum progression.

**Update frequency**: Every session

**Key metrics**:
- Mastery level (1-10 scale)
- Concepts learned vs in-progress
- Learning style and patterns

**Anti-pattern**: Don't move to next topic without mastery evidence

---

### Mentor (Medium Need)
**Track selectively**: Growth indicators over time, relationship stage.

**Update frequency**: After milestones

**Key metrics**:
- Growth focus confidence
- Relationship stage (trust â†’ guiding â†’ autonomy)
- Career progress toward target role

**Anti-pattern**: Don't over-specify steps (mentoring is guided discovery, not instruction)

---

### Consultant / Guru (Low Need)
**Track optionally**: Most consultants don't need progress tracking.

**When useful**: Long-term engagements, recurring clients

**What to track**: Recommendations made, decisions implemented, outcomes
