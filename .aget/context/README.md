## Creation Protocol

### When to Create

**First session**: Create client context file with basic information.

**Information sources**:
- What client shares directly
- Observable from interaction style
- Inferred from questions and concerns (mark as "observed, not confirmed")

---

### Initial Creation

```python
# At end of first session (wind down)
Write: .aget/context/{client_id}.yaml

# Populate with:
# - Basic identification (role, team, challenges)
# - Initial preferences (if observed)
# - First impressions (behavioral patterns)
```

---

## Update Protocol

### When to Update

**Update frequency**:
- Coach/Teacher: Every 3-5 sessions (high context dependency)
- Mentor: When significant context changes (role change, new goals)
- Consultant: When engagement scope shifts
- Guru: Rarely (static context)

**What triggers update**:
- Client shares new information ("I got promoted")
- Preferences become clear ("I realize I need more direct feedback")
- Patterns observed over multiple sessions
- Goals shift

---

### How to Update

```python
# During or after session (when context learned)
Edit: .aget/context/{client_id}.yaml

# Add or update fields:
# - New current_challenges
# - Refined communication_style
# - Updated role or team_size
# - New behavioral_pattern observed
```

---

## Usage Protocol

### At Wake Up

**Load context automatically** (silent):
- Know client's role, challenges, preferences
- Tailor communication style
- Prepare relevant examples

**Display if helpful**:
```
üìç Context: Engineering Manager, 8-person team
üéØ Focus: Strategic thinking development
```

---

### During Session

**Personalize guidance**:
- Use client's domain for examples
- Reference their stated challenges
- Adapt to communication preferences

**Example**:
```
# Generic advice (no context)
"Delegation requires trust."

# Personalized advice (with context)
"You mentioned your team is 8 engineers. At that scale, you can't
 be involved in every decision. Sarah's architecture review is a
 perfect delegation opportunity - she's senior enough, and you've
 been wanting to test her strategic thinking anyway."
```

---

### When Context Changes

**Acknowledge and update**:
```
User: "I got promoted to Senior Manager last week."

Advisor: "Congratulations! That's a significant shift.
          Let me update your context - you're now managing how many
          people? And has your focus changed from IC transition to
          something else?"

[Updates role, team_size, aspirations in context file]
```

---

## Privacy & Sensitivity

**Data classification**: Highly sensitive (career aspirations, fears, personal patterns)

**Access control**: Advisor agent only (never shared externally)

**Retention**: Duration of relationship + 90 days

**Deletion**: When relationship ends, client can request deletion

**Transparency**: Client should know what context is being tracked. If asked, share the context file.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Recording Too Much (Overwriting Boundaries)

**Bad**:
```yaml
personal_life:
  relationship_status: "Married"
  children: 2
  hobbies: "Rock climbing"
  mental_health: "Struggles with anxiety"
```

**Why it fails**: Crosses professional boundary unless client explicitly shares for relevant reason.

**Good**: Only record professional context unless personal context directly impacts professional development (e.g., "Balancing parenting and principal role" is relevant).

---

### ‚ùå Recording Without Evidence

**Bad**:
```yaml
behavioral_patterns:
  - "Avoids conflict"  # Inferred from one observation
  - "Lacks confidence"  # Assumed, not validated
```

**Why it fails**: One data point isn't a pattern. Labeling can harm.

**Good**: Wait for pattern (3+ observations) or mark as hypothesis.
```yaml
observed_once_not_yet_pattern:
  - "Hesitated on decision in 2025-10-10 session (conflict with peer)"
  - "Need more data to determine if this is pattern or situational"
```

---

### ‚ùå Not Updating Context

**Bad**:
```yaml
# Context created 2025-08-01, never updated
role: "Senior Engineer"  # Client is now Staff Engineer
aspirations: "Tech Lead"  # Client achieved, now wants Principal
```

**Why it fails**: Stale context leads to irrelevant guidance.

**Good**: Update context when changes happen or patterns become clear.
