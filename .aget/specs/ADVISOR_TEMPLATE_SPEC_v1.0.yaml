    Standard maturity - Complete EARS patterns, enforcement mechanisms documented.
    Advisor template for advisory agents with 5 persona types and scoped write permissions.

    v2.0.0 Changes (2025-10-10):
    - Added scoped write permission model (CAP-028, CAP-029, CAP-030)
    - Enables internal memory (.aget/sessions/, .aget/memory/, .aget/tracking/)
    - Maintains external read-only safety (user files, src/, tests/, AGENTS.md)
    - 3 new contract tests (19 total: 16 original + 3 scoped write)

    v1.0.0 Baseline:
    - Based on L95 (role enforcement), L114 (requirements first), L118 (role clarity), D11 (terminology)
    - Hybrid enforcement: Declarations (version.json) + Contract tests + Documentation protocols
    - Persona differentiation is behavioral (metadata-only), not technically enforced
