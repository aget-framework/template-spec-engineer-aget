    Standard maturity - Complete EARS patterns, enforcement mechanisms documented.
    Advisor template for read-only advisory agents with 5 persona types.
    Based on L95 (role enforcement), L114 (requirements first), L118 (role clarity), D11 (terminology).
    Hybrid enforcement: Declarations (version.json) + Contract tests + Documentation protocols.
    Persona differentiation is behavioral (metadata-only), not technically enforced.
