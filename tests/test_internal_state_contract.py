"""
Contract tests for advisor internal state capability.

These tests verify that advisor agents correctly implement internal state management
per ADVISOR_INTERNAL_STATE_SPEC.md and ADVISOR_SCOPED_WRITES_SPEC.md.

Tests:
1. Internal state directories exist
2. README files document formats
3. version.json declares internal state features
4. Scoped write permissions configured correctly
